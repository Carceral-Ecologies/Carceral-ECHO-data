# README.md

This repository aims to document the Carceral Ecology project, that is being developed by Professor Nicholas Shapiro, UCLA, and Professor Lindsay Poirier, UCD. 

Incarcerated people are on the frontlines of environmental injustice. This systematic exposure of, at a minimum, tens of thousands of incarcerated individuals results from mass incarceration‚Äôs close ties with declining, but very much ongoing, industrialism. Often built atop the brownfields of former manufacturing facilities or mines or on the cheap land next to operating facilities, prisons serve as a ‚Äúrecession-proof‚Äù employer to those laid off in deindustrialization beginning in the 1970s. This project seeks to assess the environmental hazards of mass incarceration on a national scale. 

This project has three main arms:
1. Envrionmental monitoring
2. Itterative study design with stakeholders
3. Data analysis of datasets that may cast light on the environmental conditions of prisons, jail, and detention centers.

It is the third compenent that has likley led you here. We are managing our work flow through the [issues](https://github.com/Carceral-Ecologies/Carceral-ECHO-data/issues) function. Thats probably the best place to start contributing. 

## How to Contribute

* Existing issues:
  * Review this repo's [issue queue](https://github.com/Carceral-Ecologies/Carceral-ECHO-data/issues) (and particularly the issues labeled "Help Wanted") for opportunities to contribute to open questions and ongoing tasks. 
  * Assign yourself to issues you are contributing to so that the group knows who to contact in regards to the issue.
  * Comment on issues with relevant ideas or resources. 
  * Mark your progress on issues in this repo's [project board](https://github.com/Carceral-Ecologies/Carceral-ECHO-data/projects).
* New issues
  * File a new issue via this repo's [issue queue](https://github.com/Carceral-Ecologies/Carceral-ECHO-data/issues), asking a question, documenting a bug, or suggesting a direction for further research and development. 
  * Assign yourself or others to issues so that the group knows who to contact in regards to the issue.
  * Select Labels to note whether the issue is a question, bug, or a suggested enhancement. Select the "Help Wanted" label to signal that you are looking for collaborators on the issue.
  * If the issue contributes to a project or milestone, be sure to add this label.
  * Mark your progress on issues in this repo's [project board](https://github.com/Carceral-Ecologies/Carceral-ECHO-data/projects).
* When contributing code, please be sure to:
  * Fork this repository, modify the code (changing only one thing at a time), and then issue a pull request for each change.
  * Follow the project's coding style (using K&R-style indentation and bracketing, commenting above each feature, and using snake case for variables).
  * Test your code locally before issuing a pull request (not sure how to do this? [here's how](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)).
  * Clearly state the purpose of your change in the description field for each commit.
  * After your first pull request is approved, please add yourself to the contributors list in the README as is appropriate.
