This repository aims to document the Carceral Ecology project, that is being developed out of the lab of Professor Nicholas Shapiro, UCLA, in collaboration with Lindsay Poirier, UCD. 

This project has three main arms:
1. Envrionmental monitoring
2. Itterative study design with stakeholders
3. Data analysis of datasets that may cast light on the environmental conditions of prisons, jail, and detention centers. 

It is the third compenent that has likley led you here. We are managing our work flow through the (issues)[https://github.com/Carceral-Ecologies/Carceral-ECHO-data/issues] function. Thats probably the best place to start contributing.
