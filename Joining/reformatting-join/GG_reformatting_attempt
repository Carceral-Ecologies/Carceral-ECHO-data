## trying to alter Lindsay's code for transforming data with multiple FRS IDs in one columns to having one FRS ID per row. 
## Question for anyone who may be able to asnwer. The file written by this code has duplicated rows in addition to separating the Total_FRS_IDS into separate rows. Why? 

library(tidyverse)
GG_manual_coding_hifld_prisons_to_FRS <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\User\\Documents\\carceral ecologies\\GG_manual_coding_hifld_prisons_to_FRS.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

reformatted_GG_manual_coding_hifld_prisons_to_FRS <- 
  GG_manual_coding_hifld_prisons_to_FRS %>% 
  separate_rows(Total_FRS_IDS) 

write.csv(reformatted_GG_manual_coding_hifld_prisons_to_FRS, "reformatted_GG_manual_coding_hifld_prisons_to_FRS.csv")
