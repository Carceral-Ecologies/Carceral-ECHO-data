# What is considered "hazardous waste" and "acute hazardous waste" regarding RCRA?
There are four general RCRA categorizations of hazardous waste: F, K, P, and U. The following document elucidates these four categorizations along with these classifications’ connection with waste and its consideration as hazardous versus acute hazardous. 

**Waste can be assumed to be acute hazardous waste if it is any P-listed waste or one of the following F-listed wastes: F020, F021, F022, F023, F026, and F027. [This]( https://www.epa.gov/hw/criteria-definition-solid-waste-and-solid-and-hazardous-waste-exclusions.)  website has a helpful diagram about defining hazardous waste in general. For simplicity, any substance that can be categorized as F, K, P, or U is considered hazardous.**

## F-List
The F-list encompass hazardous wastes from nonspecific sources, and as such, encompass processes from a wide array of sectors. These are the F-list subgroups:
* Spent solvent wastes (F001 – F005)
* Wastes from electroplating and other metal finishing operations (F006 – F012, and F019)
* Dioxin bearing wastes (F020 – F023 and F026 – F028)
* Wastes from production of certain chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (F024 and F025)
* Wastes from wood preserving (F032, F034, and F035)
* Petroleum refinery wastewater treatment sludges (F037 and F038)
* Multisource leachate (F039)

## K-list
The K-list encompass hazardous wastes from specific sources like petroleum refining and pesticide manufacturing wastes. These are the K-list subgroups:
* Wood preservation (K001)
* Inorganic pigment manufacturing (K002 – K008)
* Organic chemicals manufacturing (K009 – K011, K013 – K030, K083, K085, K093 – K096, K103 – K105, K107 – K118, K136, K149 – K151, K156 – K159, K161, K174 – K175, and K181)
* Inorganic chemicals manufacturing (K071, K073, K106, and K176 – K178)
* Pesticides manufacturing (K031 – K043, K097 – K099, K123 – K126, and K131 – K132)
* Explosives manufacturing (K044 – K047)
* Petroleum refining (K048 – K052, and K169 – K172)
* Iron and steel production (K061 and K062)
* Primary aluminum production (K088)
* Secondary lead processing (K069 and K100)
* Veterinary pharmaceuticals manufacturing (K084 and K101 – K102)
* Ink formulation (K086)
* Coking (K060, K141 – K145, and K147 – K148)

## P-List and U-List
The P-list and U-list both encompass unused pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and pesticides to be disposed, where the U-list identifies toxic wastes.

**The code for each process or chemical is in the form of X###, where X represents F, K, P, or U, and ### represents a sequence of three numbers. Scrutinize the P list and the specified F listed chemicals if you want to specify a waste as hazardous or acute hazardous. You can explore the hazardous wastes of interest through the website here:
