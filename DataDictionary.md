# Data Dictionary
*The following information features a dictionary of jargon, specifically relevant to the ECHO database. This serves as a starting point in understanding the terms used in the ECHO dataset.*

There are a number of known data issues within ECHO please click [this](https://echo.epa.gov/resources/echo-data/known-data-problems) link to see those problems itemized by regulation.

## ECHO
* Enforcement and Compliance History Online
* The ECHO database refers to a public, online repository in which the public can search facilities of interest to evaluate compliance with environmental regulations

## Facility
* Refers to the locus of interest, or place that must abide environmental regulations
* Facilities feature characteristics like a facility name, facility id, SIC code, and NAICS code
* Facilities are also characterized by whether they are currently active/operating, if they are considered major facilities, and their restrictions in media

## SIC Code
* Standard Industrial Classification
* A 4 digit code designed to classify facilities 
* The code 9223 may be a specific code of interest, as it denotes correctional institutions

## NAICS Code
* North American Industry Classification System
* A 6 digit code used by the U.S., Canada, and Mexico to classify businesses by industry
* The code 922140 may be a specific code of interest, as it denotes correctional institutions

## Violation
* Refers to the state in which a facility is noted as out of compliance with an environmental statute or regulation
* ECHO database only tracks four environmental statutes: Clean Air Act (CAA), Clean Water Act (CWA), Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCVA), and Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA)
* Echo does **NOT** provide data on violations at CWA direct discharge minor facilities, CAA mobile source and asbestos violations, Toxic Substances Control Act and Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act violations, Superfund violations, and CWA wetlands and pretreatment violations

## Enforcement
* Enforcement is five-pronged, comprised of the following aspects: compliance monitoring, civil enforcement actions, criminal enforcement actions, compliance incentives, and compliance assitance
* There are 3 possible enforcement actions:
1. Civil Administrative Action - Non-judicial action from the EPA or state taking the form of a Superfund notice letter or an order, with a possibility to incur penalties, directing a facility to adhere to sufficient compliance
2. Civil Judicial Actions - Formal lawsuits agains institutions that have failed to abide environmental regulations, comply with an order, pay the EPA to clean up, or clean up the environmental issue themselves
3. Criminal Actions - Severe action reserved for facilities intentionally committed

## Penalty
* Penalties most often result in a fee as a result of noncompliance with enviromental regulations

## Compliance, Noncompliance, and Significant Noncompliance
* A facility is said to be in compliance if it adheres to environmental regulations
* Facilities may have the statuses "Noncompliance" and "Significant Noncompliance" (SNC) in regards to compliance with the Clean Water Act and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act programs or "High Priority Violation (HPV)" and "Serious Violator" in regards to compliance with the Safe Drinking Water Act program 
* A status of "Resolved Pending" under the CWA program is a compliance status designation noting a facility's compliance with an enforcement order, but is not in full compliance with permit conditions
* The database also features three year compliance history by quarter

## Inspection
* ECHO database features number of inspections within 5 years, including the dates of the inspections
* There are lag times between the date of the inspection and the time the data is posted, sometimes spanning months
* Inspections, information gathering, and self-reported data spurs warning letters or notice of violation
* Smaller facilities may receive less frequeny inspections

## Quarter
* A quarter is a unit of time that spans three months and is the standard base unit for reporting noncompliance events or violations in ECHO. For the Clean Water Act, the permittee will generally report three times within the quarter.
* There are four quarters in a year
* The ECHO Database also allows individuals to explore data in monthly time increments

## Hazardous Waste Generator
* Under RCRA, persons and facilities that generate waste are considered hazardous waste generators
* A hazardous waste generator may appear in the ECHO database depending on its categorization as a very small quantity generator, a small quantity generator, and a large quantity generator
* Please click [here] (https://www.epa.gov/hwgenerators/hazardous-waste-generator-regulatory-summary#table) to see requirements

## Public Water System
* Under the SDWA, public water systems are defined as a system that provides water for human consumption for at least 15 service connections or regularly serves at least 25 individuals at least 60 days out of the year
* Public Water systems can further be categorized as:
1. Community
- A water system that serves the same population throughout the year
2. Non-Transient/Non-Community
-  A public water system that regularly supplies water to at least 25 of the same people at least six months per year, but not year-round
3. Transient/Non-Community
- A public water system that provides water in a place such as a gas station or campground where people do not remain for a long period of time
