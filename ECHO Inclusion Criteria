| RCRA                  | Persons and facilities that produce waste are called hazardous waste generators. RCRA monitors established standards of these hazardous waste generators. A facility does not need an EPA ID number if it is considered a "very small quantity generator."                     | There are three general requirements for a facility to be considered a "very small quanity generator:" The facilities must produce less than or equal to 100kg/month of hazardous waste, less than or equal to 1kg/month of acute hazardous waste, and less than 100 kg/month of acute spill residue or soil                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | See chart in link for evidence                                                                                                               | https://www.epa.gov/hwgenerators/hazardous-waste-generator-regulatory-summary#table                                                                                                      |
| SDWA                  | The SDWA ensures that public water systems, often abbreviated as PWS, provide water safe for human consumption.                                                                                                                                                                | SDWA does not need to be regulated if it is not considered a PWS. A PWS has at least 15 service connections or regularly serves at least 25 individuals at least 60 days out of the year. Moreover, the SDWA does not have the jurisdiction to moderate private water wells.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | This seems strange to me--these facilities definitely serve at least 25 individuals at least 60 days of the year.

| CWA                   | The database requires that all direct dischargers be in the database. All direct dischargers are required to have an NPDES (National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System) permit. This permit specifies the amount of pollutant a facility can discharge in a water source. | There are specific facilities that can bypass the requirement of having an NPDES permit. These facilities are "some abandoned mines on nonfederal lands, sewage (from ships covered by EPA's Vessel Sewage Discharge Program, return flows from irrigated agriculture, most drainage ditches associated with logging roads, and most smaller feedlots and aquaculture facilities." In addition, facilities considered indirect dischargers do not need an NPDES permit, and by syllogism, it follows that they do not need to be entered into ECHO database. Indirect dischargers are facilities that send their waste into a sewer city system where the waste is processed in a sewage treatment plant before entering a water source. | We should hone in one the indirect dischargers aspect, as the other possible characterizations are inapplicable.                             | https://www.epa.gov/npdes/npdes-permit-basics                                                                                                                                            |
| CAA                   | The EPA only requires that major (larger) facilities be reported to the EPA. Minor (smaller) facilities do not need to be reported to the EPA, but some states enter this data on a voluntary basis.                                                                           | "The major source threshold for any air pollutant is 100 tons/year," while the "Major source thresholds for “hazardous air pollutants” (HAP) are 10 tons/year for a single HAP or 25 tons/year for any combination of HAP."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                              | https://echo.epa.gov/resources/general-info/echo-faq#larger_smaller_facilities                               https://www.epa.gov/title-v-operating-permits/who-has-obtain-title-v-permit |
